* Accelerometer usage
** Button based interface
1. Hold button
2. Start drawing image based on relative position
   - The image is wrapped when hitting the edge, maybe a sound could play when
     this occurs

The benefit of this is that we have better control when the image starts
drawing, so that we don't start the exposure in the middle of the animation.

** Automatic interface
No button press needed. The image is always drawn based on the relative position.

** Integrating the position

- We get the acceleration on one axis
  - We have to integrate it twice to get the position
- When we have the relative position we can calculate which frame to show in the
  animation. We should have some way to measure it in metric units so that we
  can change the frames in relation to the LED strip dimensions.
